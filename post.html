				<p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-5">
					This Beautiful Mind? It’s one we’ll be coming back to again and again.
				</p>

				<p class="py-6">Let’s do a quick recap on their last album, Live and Fall. It was raw, loud, and full of emotion; like a band working through everything they were feeling in real time. Tracks like “Break the Brake” and “PLUTO” exploded with frustration and fire, while “Good Enough” and “Paranoid” tapped into something more vulnerable. It felt like a storm in motion.</p>				
			
				<p class="py-6">Now with Beautiful Mind, the energy shifts. The chaos is still there, but this time, they’re not trying to escape it. They’re learning to sit with it, question it, and maybe even find something worth holding onto.</p>

				<p>
					If there’s one song on Beautiful Mind that feels like a warm hug in the middle of the chaos, it’s “Diamond.” The lyrics hit home:</p>

				<blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-500 italic my-8 pl-8 md:pl-12">“I’m not perfect, but I’m still shining bright.
					Even when I’m broken, I’m a diamond in the light.”.
				</blockquote>
				<p class="py-6">It’s all about accepting yourself even with flaws and finding strength in that. The music matches perfectly: the melody is smooth but powerful, with a steady beat that feels like a heartbeat reminding you that you’re worth it. Diamond isn’t about being flawless; it’s about owning your worth no matter what. If you listen closely, you might find a bit of your own story in there.
				</p>

			
				<p class="py-6">At first, the title “George the Lobster” might make you raise an eyebrow. Song about a lobster? In KPOP? But don’t let that fool you. This track is unexpectedly good. It’s playful and quirky, with a catchy melody that sticks with you.</p>

				<p class="py-6">Supernatural slows things down and gets a bit more personal. It’s about those feelings that are hard to explain, when you just don’t know what’s going on inside. The music is softer, and the vocals feel honest and calm. It’s a song that’s easy to relate to, reminding you it’s okay to have complicated emotions.
					Makes you wonder, who hurt you? Did Day6 teach you how to write this ?
				</p>

				<p class="py-6">After all those softer, deeper songs, “FIGHT ME” hits like a jolt of energy. It’s loud, raw, and straight-up confident like the band saying, “We’re not backing down.” The guitars cut sharp, and the vocals have that fire you can’t ignore. It’s a perfect reminder that sometimes you just have to stand your ground and say, “Bring it on.”</p>
				<p class="py-6">Then “Beautiful Life” takes things to another level with its dramatic, almost theatrical vibe. It’s intense and bold, asking tough questions about reality and what really matters. The messy, chaotic feel fits perfectly because sometimes life itself doesn’t make sense, and this song captures that confusion and power all at once.</p>
				<p class="py-6">Together, these tracks remind you that Beautiful Mind isn’t just about quiet reflection—it’s also about shouting out loud when it matters most.</p>
				<p>Xdinary Heroes have given us more than just an album with Beautiful Mind—they’ve shared a journey.
					 Through the highs, the lows, the fights, and the quiet moments, they remind us that it’s okay to be messy, confused, and still shining.
					  Thanks for inviting us into your mind, Xdinary Heroes.
